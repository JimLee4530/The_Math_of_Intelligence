## Intro_to_the_Math_of_intelligence
This is a Coding Challenge Submission for week 1 of "The Math of Intelligence" by Siraj Raval on Youtube. Here I have taken a dataset of World Happiness Report (Happiness scored according to economic production, social support, etc.) from kaggle from which I have taken 2 variables in considaration (Freedom and HappinessScore).
I use **batch stochastic gradient descent** to fit the line in sgd_demo.py.
you can see it. http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes1.pdf
